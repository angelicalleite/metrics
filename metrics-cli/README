The metrics CLI project
=======================

This provides runnable services that subscribe to occurrence change events, and modify the downstream cubes.

At the time of writing there is the occurrence cube and the density tiles for the maps, but future enhancements 
will likely include other options.  

To run this, it is expected that you would build the project as a single jar:
  $ mvn clean assembly:single
  
And then run it using a config file.  

Example complete config files are given in the example-conf folder, with placeholders to supply messaging credentials, and the location of the HBase configuration file. 

Examples (note you can pass a standard logback xml file in the properties as shown in the second example):

$ java -Xmx1G -jar target/metrics-cli-0.5-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar DensityCube --conf ./conf/density-updater.yaml
$ java -Xmx1G -jar target/metrics-cli-0.5-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar OccurrenceCube --conf ./conf/occurrence-updater.yaml --log-config /Users/tim/dev/conf/logback-crawler.xml

If you run the application without any parameters, full instructions are given listing the available services.

It should be noted that you can override any property from the configuration file (or omit it) and supply it with the --property-name option.
