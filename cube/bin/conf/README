In order to run the backfills you'll need the following configuration files in this (/cube/bin/conf) directory:
- core-site.xml
- hbase-site.xml
- hdfs-site.xml
- mapred-site.xml
- yarn-site.xml

You can get a current copy to match your target environment (ie dev, uat, or prod) from the the corresponding directory
in https://github.com/gbif/gbif-configuration/tree/master/metrics-ws

Please don't then commit them to this directory!
